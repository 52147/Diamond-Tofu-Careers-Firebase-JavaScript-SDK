              candidates for employment, and participants of our optional
              recruiting programs and events. If you are a California resident,
              please see the California Addendum at the end of this Privacy
              Policy for further details on how we handle your information and
              how to exercise your rights. Some of our online recruiting
              activities enable access to external sites operated by third
              parties, which are not governed by this Privacy Policy. We
              encourage you to review the privacy policies of any such sites
              before you submit information there. <br /><br />
              WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT? <br />
              The types of personal information that Diamond Tofu

              apply is available in more than one country, the types of personal

              employees who referred you for the role in order to populate your
              profile. As a result, you may see information in your profile
